Hello! Welcome to my portfolio.

I’m a security engineer based in the Bay Area, currently specializing in **security investigations** and **cloud-scale threat detection**. I built this site to showcase my experience, my professional and personal projects, and soon, my reflections from the frontlines of the security battlefield.

With over six years of experience in **digital forensics and incident response** (DFIR), my passions lie in blending technical analysis with human insights. Whether I'm reconstructing an attack timeline, conducting root-cause analysis, or implementing proactive risk measures, I thrive on translating technical findings into clear narratives. As **automation** starts to reshape day-to-day security work, I’ve lately become particularly focused on teaching LLMs to reason and communicate like seasoned, human investigators. (Automation only works when efficiency is paired with accuracy!)

I began my career in 2019 as a junior **cybersecurity consultant** and, over five years, grew into a manager who **incident commanded** ransomware, business email compromise (BEC), advanced persistent threat (APT), and other similar high-severity engagements. During that period, I developed a deep expertise in Windows forensics, helping enterprise organizations not only recover, but strengthen their defenses from security threats. Most recently, I moved to San Francisco in Oct. 2024 to further immerse myself in the security world, serving on OpenAI’s Intelligence and Investigations team where I focused on detecting and mitigating **insider risks**.

Right now, I’m deepening my **macOS** internals knowledge and expanding my detection engineering skill sets. I believe in building automated solutions that balance **technical accuracy**, **practical usability**, but most importantly, **real‑world impact**.
