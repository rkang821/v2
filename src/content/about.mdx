Welcome to my porfolio. I'm a security professional living in the Bay area.

I’m a Security Engineer with a passion for solving complex problems at the intersection of cloud infrastructure, human behavior, and machine learning. My work has spanned incident response, insider risk, detection engineering, and security automation—with a growing focus on securing AI systems. I enjoy building tools that streamline investigations and expose adversarial behaviors that traditional approaches overlook.

I’ve led high-impact investigations into insider threats, developed large-scale detection pipelines, and co-authored a generative AI investigation platform that reduced triage time by over 35%. My experience spans AWS, Azure, and GCP environments, and I frequently work with Python, SQL, and tools like Databricks, Tines, and CrowdStrike. I believe good security engineering is grounded in empathy: for the analyst, the end user, and the adversary.

Outside of work, I’m a mentor, an avid reader of forensic case studies, and a firm believer that every detection rule should be explainable and every risk should be human-interpretable. Whether I’m tuning a SIEM or prototyping a Slackbot to support my team, my goal is always the same: reduce complexity, increase clarity, and build security systems that actually help people.
